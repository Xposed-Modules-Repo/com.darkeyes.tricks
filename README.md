This module is designed for Android 8.0, 8.1, 9, 10, 11, 12, 12.1, 13 and 14. Some tricks might not work on every version though. It has been tested on stock Android 14 on a Pixel 7 Pro. You can try it on other ROMs, but don't report bugs if something doesn't work.

Version 3.0 and up are designed for Android 14 only. All older Android version must use version 2.31.

Here is what the module can do:

- Force dark theme even on light wallpaper (Android 8.1 only)
- Replace voice assist with phone on lockscreen (Android 8.0 and 8.1 only)
- Always show the navbar on the right when in landscape (Android 8.0, 8.1 and 9 only)
- Hide next alarm on the lockscreen and in the quick settings and the icon in the status bar
- Show 4G instead of LTE
- Hide LTE+/4G+ (always show LTE/4G)
- Hide ADB notification
- Hide VPN notification
- Hide "Network may be monitored"
- Hide the build version in the QS when developer options are enabled (Android 10+)
- Double tap to sleep on statusbar or lockscreen (Android 12+ but not Android 14)
- Volume keys control cursor
- Volume keys skip track
- Power key toggle torch (with proximity check)
- Prevent accidental wake up
- Less frequent notifications
- Screen off notifications only
- Change the carrier text
- Bypass Outlook device policy
- Quick unlock (Android 12+ but not Android 14)

There is a simple user interface that can be launched through Xposed Manager to choose what mods that you want. A reboot is needed every time you change a setting for version 2.31 and older. Starting with version 3.0, all settings can be applied at runtime (except for Show 4G and Hide LTE+/4G+ which still require a reboot).
